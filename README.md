## 🏗️ How This Portfolio Was Built

### Frontend Architecture
- Built using **React with TypeScript** for type safety and maintainable code
- Components are modularized into reusable sections (Navbar, Hero, Contact, etc.)
- Clean separation of concerns between layout, logic, and UI components

### Styling & UI
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive design
- UI components are built with **shadcn/ui** for consistency and accessibility
- Custom gradients, animations, and transitions to enhance user experience
- Fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Navigation & UX Enhancements
- Smooth scrolling navigation using anchor links and browser-native behavior
- Fixed navbar with scroll-based styling changes
- Mobile-friendly hamburger menu with auto-close behavior
- Clear call-to-action buttons guiding users to the contact section

### Contact Form Implementation

- No backend required, keeping the project lightweight and secure
- Includes:
  - Loading state to prevent duplicate submissions
  - Success message feedback after submission
  - Spam protection using honeypot technique
  - Email verification handled by FormSubmit

### Performance & Deployment
- Optimized for fast load times and minimal bundle size
- Deployed on **Vercel** with automatic CI/CD from GitHub
